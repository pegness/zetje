          <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
          <p>THESE TERMS OF USE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE, FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. WE WILL NOTIFY YOU OF AMENDMENTS TO THESE TERMS OF USE BY UPDATING THEM IN THE APPLICATION AND/OR ON THE WEBSITE.</p>
          <p>Stichting LittleBitz (“LittleBitz” or “we”) is a social start-up powered by committed individuals, companies and organisations from the public and private sector. The objects of LittleBitz are to provide financial and other support to victims of humanitarian crises and to promote their rehabilitation. We are a non-profit foundation with ANBI status, based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>The application Zetje is referred to as the “Service”. The access to and use of the Service constitutes acceptance by you or the entity you represent (“User” or “you”) of the following terms and conditions of use (the “Terms of Use”). If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not access or use the Service.</p>
          <p>The Service is protected by intellectual property laws worldwide. Nothing in these Terms of Use shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits on any such content. To distribute the funds, LittleBitz collaborates with trusted partners like UNHCR, a subsidiary body of the United Nations and Give Directly, a non-profit organisation that lets donors send money directly to the world’s poorest ("Partners").</p>
          <h2>Donations & Payments</h2>
          <p>The fundraising opportunity recognised by LittleBitz is provided for by enabling the User to donate the payment, in part or in full, to LittleBitz or, as and when applicable, to one or more LittleBitz charities. In order to do so, the User requesting for the payment request to be created, can share the payment request with one or more recipients. The recipients of the payment request can complete the payment. The pay-out is done according to the instructions of the User: a share is paid out to the User, and a share of the payment is paid out as a donation to LittleBitz. </p>

          <p>LittleBitz is not a financial institution or payment service provider. LittleBitz’ services do not fall within the scope of regulated services. To facilitate the processing of donations from the User, LittleBitz has entered into an agreement with third-party payment service provider MediaMedics B.V. ("MediaMedics"). MediaMedics and LittleBitz have made arrangements concerning the overhead costs. These costs will not be deducted from the transaction or from the donation. LittleBitz transfers the donation to the Partner (e.g. Give Directly). The Partner is responsible for transferring the donations made via the Service to the chosen recipient(s). LittleBitz will inform the User via the Service once the donation has been received by the chosen recipient(s). If, for any reason, the chosen person of concern cannot or does not collect the donation, LittleBitz will, in our sole discretion, ensure that another person of concern will receive the donation. </p>
          <p>Once a donation has been made, it is under no condition possible to get a refund.</p>
          <p>We take every reasonable care to cooperate with partners which ensure that all donations and related transactions are conducted via a secure connection. However, the security of information and payments transmitted via the internet cannot be guaranteed.</p>
